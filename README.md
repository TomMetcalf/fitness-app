## Fitness App Summary

This fitness app is a simple workout tracker, where users can log a workout, with a title, load, and number of reps. Logged workouts can be edited and deleted. All fields are required and users are alerted when trying to submit a workout with missing fields. Workouts are stored in a MongoDB database and a loading animation is shown whilst the data is retrieved from the database.

A hosted version of this app can be viewed here:

NOTE: Please allow some time for the initial data to load, as it may be slow due to being hosted on Render's free tier. Thank you for your patience.

You will need to be logged in to view workout data, as it is linked to the user.
